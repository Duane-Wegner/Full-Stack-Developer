                When I first started learning CSS, typography seemed like a background detail—important, but secondary to layout and color.
                That changed when I reached the typography section of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Suddenly, I saw how much the feel of a website
                could shift with the right choice of font, size, spacing, and alignment.

            <p class="text">
                I learned to respect the rhythm of line-height, the subtlety of letter-spacing, and the elegance of font pairing. Choosing between
                serif and sans-serif became a creative decision rather than a default. Through countless tweaks and trials, I’ve come to see typography
                not just as styling—but as storytelling. Thanks to freeCodeCamp, I now approach CSS with a designer’s eye and a developer’s precision.
