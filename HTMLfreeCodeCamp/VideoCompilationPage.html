      <h2>Creative thinking - how to get out of the box and generate ideas: Giovanni Corazza at TEDxRoma</h2>
      <p>This video is filmed and edited by Università Telematica Internazionale UNINETTUNO www.uninettunouniversity.net.
        <br>
        <br>
      Corazza is a full-time professor at the Alma Mater Studiorum at the University of Bologna, a member of the
        Executive Council, and the founder of the Marconi Institute of Creativity. He teaches science and the applications
        of creative thinking. Why/Which/How/Where/What/When/Experiment. A quick jump out of the box is more insight ful
        than a lifetime of standard thinking.
        <br>
        <br>
      In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people
        together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep
        discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
        independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
        individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</p>
